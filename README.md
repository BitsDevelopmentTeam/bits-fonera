Fonera and STM32
================

This repository contains Fonera and stm32 software for the BITS repository.

Currently, a lot of things are mirrored here:

1. `PNG++` for PNG manipulation
2. `miosix-kernel` that runs on the STM32, which is hosted on Gitorious and has no official GH mirror
3. `mxgui` Miosix GUI components, for the same reason above

We will clean the project structure as soon as we determine the best way to manage external dependencies.
